# Documentation Summary

## Navigation
The navigation system is a crucial part of the documentation structure:

- Configured through `mint.json`
- Supports recursive/nested navigation groups
- Pages must be manually added to appear in navigation
- File extensions (`.mdx`) are not needed in navigation configuration

### Key Navigation Features
1. **Basic Structure**
   - Uses JSON format in `mint.json`
   - Groups pages under logical sections
   - Requires explicit page listing

2. **Folder Organization**
   - Pages can be organized in folders
   - URL structure follows folder structure
   - Example: `your-folder/your-page` creates URL `yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page`
   - Note: Top-level `api` folder name is reserved

3. **Hidden Pages**
   - Pages not listed in `mint.json` won't appear in sidebar
   - Hidden pages are still searchable
   - Direct links to hidden pages remain functional
